ðŸ‘‰&nbsp; **[Live Preview](https://crwn-aprl.herokuapp.com/ "CRWN APPAREL")**

CRWN Apparel is an e-commerce clothing and accessories website with common features that resembles a modern-day e-commerce platform. Users can sign up for their very own account on the website and add any of the available items to their shopping cart for checkout.

Note: **As CRWN Apparel is not an actual commerical business, payments charged at checkout on the website are for testing purposes only and are _NOT REAL_ payments! For this, a test credit-card by Stripe has been provided at the checkout page for users to try out the payment processing of the application.**

FYI: _**If you would like to try out the application but do not wish to manually sign up or sign in using your own Google account, you can use the provided test account below.**_

## :muscle: Motivation
In an effort to further improve my skills as a software engineer working with the React library, I wanted to build an application that would mimic a development environment in a professional capacity. As every development experience and workflow is unique in itself in both personal & professional work projects, the main goal here was to build something that a developer would commonly encounter when working in professional projects and to contribute a fully fleshed-out & working project to my professional portfolio.

This lead me to the idea of creating an e-commerce application that carries the common features of modern web applications, such as user account creation and login, a customizable shopping cart unique to each user, checkout functionality such as payments and more. To ensure the best development and learning experience while building out this project, the choice to go for an e-commerce website was motivated by the widely-available support for building such applications as e-commerce platforms developed using React are a commonality in software development.
